This is the source code for the program developed for the paper "Explaining a Staff Rostering Problem using Partial Solutions".

(As of 28/06/2024 I'm working on cleaning up the repository)

The repository consists of
* code from the paper I expanded upon (contained in the directory FirstPaper)
* code for the new approach
* The files to construct the Staff Rostering problem definition, which is the same as Martin Fyvie
* some files to carry out the statistical testing and plotting (the directory TestsAndPlots)
* A description of the rota patterns used in the benchmark problems (in resources/BT/benchmark_problems_for_staff_rostering.pdf)
